  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>Here's my most recent conference bio:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Simon Willison is the creator of
      <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>, an open source tool for
      exploring and publishing data. He currently works full-time building open
      source tools for data journalism, built around Datasette and SQLite.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prior to becoming an independent open source developer, Simon was an
      engineering director at Eventbrite. Simon joined Eventbrite through their
      acquisition of Lanyrd, a Y Combinator funded company he co-founded in
      2010.
    </p>

    <p>
      He is a co-creator of the Django Web Framework, and has been blogging
      about web development and programming since 2002 at
